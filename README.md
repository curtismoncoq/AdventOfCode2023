# Advent of Code 2023: A Coding Journey

Welcome to my repository for the 2023 Advent of Code challenge. 

In this endeavor, I'll be utilizing my reliable `libft.a` static library. Even if I find the "Norme 42" format useful to learn, I've chosen to not adhere to it for this project due to the additional workload it would entail.

I hope you find the journey through this code as enlightening as I did while crafting it. Enjoy the exploration!

Happy Coding!
